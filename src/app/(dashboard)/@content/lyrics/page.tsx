        I call you when I need you, my heart s on fire You come to me, come to
        me wild and wild When you come to me Give me everything I need Give me a
        lifetime promises and a world of dreams Speak a language of love like
        you know what it means And it can t be wrong Take my heart and make it
        strong baby [Chorus:] You re simply the best Better than all the rest
        Better than anyone Anyone I ve ever met I m stuck on your heart I hang
        on every word you say Tear us apart Baby, I would rather be dead In your
        heart, I see the star of every night and every day In your eyes I get
        lost, I get washed away Just as long as I m here in your arms I could be
        in no better place [Chorus] Each time you leave me I start losing
        control You re walking away with my heart and my soul I can feel you
        even when I m alone Oh, baby, don t let go [Chorus]
      </p>
